I'm a final year PhD student in department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof Nitin Saxena](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/). Before this I did my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineeing from [KCC ITM, Gr Noida](https://www.kccitm.edu.in/) an affiliated institution of [Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow](https://aktu.ac.in/).

My research interest lies in the area of Theoretical Computer Science. Specifically, I work in the domain of Algebraic Complexity Theory. At times I also like to spend time to study areas like Graph Theory, Algorithms, Computational Number Theory and Group Testing Problems. 

I am an avid reader and a bibliophile. Usually, I don't have a preference over the genre, but I do like to read well-researched fiction, biographies and self-help books. Outside Academia, I prefer to spend time with people discussing books, unless of course, I'm reading a book. Occasionally I blog post [here](https://prateekdwivedi.in/blog) on things of general interest to me, that deserves a more permanent form than a social media post.
