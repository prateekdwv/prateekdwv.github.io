title: PhD and Finances
subtitle: Managing finances during graduate studies 
---

I started my fifth year of PhD last August, and with that, I entered that phase where new joiners were looking for advice in various domains of graduate life. I was invited to a panel discussion as a panellist to share my advice with a wider audience. I realised that nothing new could have been said to them, but re-emphasising the same points brought reassurance that it will all turn out well.

Monetary challenges during graduate studies are one of the primary reasons for discouragement to continuing studies. In Indian academia, PhD students get ₹35T (₹31T for the first two years), which is significantly less compared to other countries, even after considering the purchase power parity. It forces us to reprioritise ambitions, bringing in readjustments which could be hard to accept but needed nevertheless.

It certainly helps if one has the necessary financial awareness, which develops with experience, and is not discussed at a young age. This is why those joining after spending some years in the industry don’t sweat from it. I wanted to write on it, as for some it may be “emphasis” though for others it could be “re-emphasis” both of which I hope brings “reassurance”.

The suggestions I want to make are unusual and are not talked about at all. I have received appreciation for them, which motivated me to turn them into a more permanent form. They may not fit everyone, but it isn’t meant to be, as they only intend to light the spark for thinking about it.

## Invest in Medical and Term Insurance

This was one of the first things I did with my first stipend, and I cannot stress the importance of it enough. It is interesting how everyone accepts the necessity of it but are still full of excuses not to buy one as soon as possible. Indian premier institutes extend health insurance to all their students, including PhD candidates, with coverage of ₹1-1.5L. A part of the premium for that cover is paid from the academic fees. Medical expenses in India are growing exponentially; on top of it, covid has worsened the situation. It is disastrous to think that such a modest amount would suffice for prolonged health care if needed.

## Save for Academic Fees and Contingencies

What is needed to continue graduate studies must be fulfilled using the stipend, which includes fees, accommodation, food, and basic transportation. Some of these expenses are not monthly, yet saving them every month takes off the load when they happen.

It also includes saving enough for academic trips, domestic or international. The institute, department or private organisation funds most such trips. But it’s a long and tedious process which takes time. Not all opportunities wait for funds to get cleared for you. Since they eventually get cleared, personal funds should be available for utilisation. Relocation expenses for post PhD opportunities also need a share of the monthly stipend.

## Spending Consciously

We tend to overspend a limited resource at the beginning only to realise its finiteness too late. Weekend outings, unplanned trips to home or vacations all add up, leaving nothing to save for the plan. Priority expenses take a back seat to compensate for unconscious spending. Budgeting properly with reasonable distribution for all types of expenses is important. In situations when PhD gets extended beyond five years, which is when the funding stops, it becomes even more essential to carefully decide on expenses.

That being said, never hesitate to spend on yourself, which helps your career grow. That might be a laptop for work, a guitar to learn on the side, or badminton for sports. Conscious spending is not to stop you from purchasing, but to encourage you to thoughtful spending.

Disciplined spending may not always be possible and unrealistic expectations can quickly take you off track. However, it is essential to get back on it because that is all readjustments we want to thrive on. The suggestions are not from a financial advisor, hence the list is not exhaustive and has its limitations, hence I would advise discretion. My intention is to motivate my readers to talk more about it, since even optimistically speaking I don’t see stipends getting revised, competitive to the industry standards, anytime soon.
