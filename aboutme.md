title: About me
subtitle: PhD Student in Theoretical Computer Science
---

I'm a first year PhD student in department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof Nitin Saxena](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nitin/). Before this I did my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineeing from [KCC ITM, Gr Noida](https://www.kccitm.edu.in/) an affiliated institution of [Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow](https://aktu.ac.in/).

I have been interested in problems lying in the domain of Algebraic Complexity Theory. Also in my free time I like to read about Graph Theoretic problems and recent advacements in them. Before recent developments in my interest, Algorithms was the only area close to me and even today I like to dwell into it when time permits.

I am an avid reader and a bibliophile. Usually I don't have a preference over genre, but I do like to read well-researched fiction, biographies and self-help books. If you are a person not interested in Academia, then this is a thing I'm always ready to discuss over a cup of Green Tea. Another things, which obviously goes without saying, I do appreciate any recommendations.
