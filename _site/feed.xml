        <title>Randomized Exact Median</title>
        <description>
          
          Median finding problem is easy to describe. In a given set of numbers of size say $n$, it is simply finding a $(n/2)^{th}$ largest element. Efficient (linear time) deterministic algorithm for solving this problem have been there for a while. Asymptotically we have achieved the best we could, but when...

        <title>Recursive-Insertion-Sort</title>
        <description>
          
          Itâ€™s hard to point merits of recursive procedures. But if one has to then it is the elegance and clarity of algorithms. For most of problems, recursive solution gives an intuition of the working of the algorithm. Though we have a very nice intuitive understanding of (usual) insertion sort, courtesy...
