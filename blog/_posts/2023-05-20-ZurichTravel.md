Apart from proving theorems and occasionally experiencing those Eureka moments, travelling and exploring new places is one of the satisfying perks of being in academia. I'm not going to deny that I was looking forward to it when I started my PhD in 2018 - and then we had the pandemic. After a long wait, I finally had a chance to attend a Theory Winter School in Zinal, Switzerland, in January. It was undoubtedly the most surreal experience of my life, and I couldn't have expected it to be any better. I am blogging about it to preserve my experience, mostly the parts that cannot be captured in any other way.

## Theory Winter School - Switzerland

It was the second edition of the winter school on theoretical computer science co-organised by EPFL and ETH Zurich in the foothills of the Swiss Alps. Five days, three courses, twelve lectures, and ample time for leisure activities and discussion - the program perhaps has the most attractive schedule of the workshops I have encountered. The workshop is particularly exclusive since invitations are extended after some profile evaluation of applicants - I couldn't get it in the first edition even though it had lectures much closer to my research interests. Nonetheless, I got the invitation this time, and it was time to fly to Switzerland.

The department generously agreed to fund my travel and visa, while the organisers arranged shared accommodation and meals. Except for the part that the Schengen Visa application requires a lot of paperwork, getting the visa was easy, primarily because the country encourages tourism and education. It helped me book inexpensive flight tickets on LOT Polish Airlines, saving me enough from the approved funds to spend an extra day in Zurich to explore the city at the end of the trip. Much to my surprise, the travel was smooth, including the immigration at both Indian and Swiss borders. On the four-and-a-half-hour journey from Zurich to Zinal with two train and two bus changes, I was filled with admiration for the public transport system of the country - especially the punctuality. On the journey, I saw the long stretch of green fields with snowy white mountains in the background, and I could not believe the mesmerising natural beauty. Zinal is a small town, famous particularly among snow sports enthusiasts, and Hotel Europe - our accommodation - was barely a few steps from the final bus stop.

Lectures by Ryan Williams on proving circuit lower bounds was the closest they would get to my current research interest, which made his talks naturally approachable. Ryan's work connecting circuit lower bounds to algorithms has gained popularity and helped achieve a new perspective on complexity theory problems. Rasmus Kyng's lectures had a primary objective to explain their celebrated result - Maximum Flow and Minimum-Cost Flow in Almost-Linear Time. While Yin Tat Lee's lectures gave a comprehensive introduction to convex optimization. I was unfamiliar with many topics covered in the winter school, including some of those covered in Williams' lectures. Moreover, it exposed me to many new tools for exploration, perhaps later in my research career.

My entire day in Zurich was spent exploring the city and its cuisine. In a well-connected city like Zurich, it was easy to experience many places in a limited time. But I was particularly interested in the old town region of the city, which is why I booked a budget hostel in that area. With three hours in the museum, two for the guided tour, and the rest for exploring food and purchasing souvenirs, I executed an almost perfect plan. It wasn't my first time exploring a city alone, so some experience helped, but I had only done it in India, so I wasn't confident. To my surprise and contrary to many travel advice sources on the internet, language wasn't a barrier in Zurich, though it was in Zinal. As a vegetarian, I did not struggle for meals anywhere, though I had to clarify the difference with being vegan in most places. Zurich was an expensive city, so I did not purchase anything but chocolates - I bought too many fine Swiss chocolates. I returned from Zurich with the same airline, with most of the time spent thinking about another trip to Europe, which I'll talk about in more detail in an upcoming post.

## Trivia

The exhilarating experience of visiting another country that is different in language, culture, and food is difficult to express in words. However, I'll share some tidbits from my trip that I enjoyed the most. 

Zinal, our workshop destination, is a popular choice among Europeans for adventure snow sports - skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, and snowshoe hiking, to list a few. Kids as young as five years of age pick up snow sports, which I find similar to how Indian kids pick up cycling, though perhaps not as adventurous as skiing. Though I considered going snowshoe hiking before the workshop, later, I had to change my plans and instead try a gondola (cable car) ride. The scenic view from the top of the mountains was incredible. It was so windy at the top that adjusting to the dropping temperature took a while - even after proper layering and insulation. At times it was awkward for only two of us to be there for the view rather than for skiing or other sport activities.

The passion for cheese in food was noticeable from early on. It was delicious and different from the usual American-style cheese we use in India. The most delicious snack I tried was chunks of certain salty cheese with pieces of bread. It was admirable to see the enthusiasm for fruits at breakfast; there was always a variety of them available daily. As a coffee and chocolate aficionado, I couldn't help but try so many different types of drinks with coffee, chocolate, or sometimes both that I felt content at the end of the trip.

There were no unusual hiccups during the entire trip, and I was able to plan it well in advance. But most importantly, it was because everything there was predictable, particularly the public transport system. My international roaming ended the morning I was leaving for India, and though my hostel in Zurich had Wi-Fi, I did not want to unnecessarily recharge just for the use of a few hours as I would get enough internet at the airport anyway. So I planned to be off the grid for my journey to the airport from old town Zurich. After confirming the timing of the train, I checked out and walked towards the station early in the morning on an almost empty street. I was amazed at the punctuality of the train, which among other things, helped me build confidence in the city infrastructure. I reached my destination on time and returned online when I was inside the airport.

My long layover in Poland made me think of the regrets from my trip - in hindsight, I should definitely be able to list a few. One was not trying any snow activity like skiing or snowshoe hiking, which I had intended to do before the trip. Another mistake I made was withdrawing cash, which I did not use throughout my journey, as cards worked everywhere. Finally, while in Zurich, I wanted to visit ETH Zurich, but there was just not enough time. What more could I have done?
